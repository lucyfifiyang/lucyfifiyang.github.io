                    <h4><p>March 2020: a world shutting down. An email from UW Medicine pleaded for volunteers to help conduct COVID-19 tests due to unprecedented demand. Despite just completing the bioengineering PhD qualification exam, I could not sit tight and take the customary short post-exam break. <strong>I was eager to tackle my next step. So, I joined UW Medicine in the fight against COVID-19. </strong>The night after my exam, I biked to UW Medical Center to work under the Specimen Processing Services (SPS) and prepare COVID-19 samples for testing. Foege may be closed, but I returned to work! I worked alongside hospital lab techs and travel nurses, sorting and labeling hundreds of specimen samples each night. Most importantly, I gained first-hand experience of COVID-19 testing that enabled me to identify problems, such as slow test turnaround times. I saw an opportunity to apply aptamers to COVID-19 testing: <strong>if we developed aptamers for rapid lateral flow tests, the diagnosis could be ready in a matter of minutes, much faster than the PCR tests I handled.</strong> Although I spent time away from research, I gained invaluable perception into COVID-19 testing and this laid the foundation for my PhD thesis work in the Pun Lab.</p></h4></div>

                      <h4><p><strong>At the Pun Lab, I lead the investigation on SARS-CoV-2-binding aptamers (short single-stranded DNA that can bind proteins) for rapid tests, such as lateral flow test strips and electrochemical detection.</strong> Despite having little background in aptamers when I first started, I not only quickly mastered our lab's aptamer protocols but also collaborated with other UW research groups. We obtained valuable patient samples from the Seattle Flu Study team and I learned new techniques from other UW Bioengineering labs, including lateral flow test strip manufacturing. Last summer, I was a first author on our <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ange.202107730" target="_blank">publication about SARS-CoV-2 aptamers</a> in <i>Angewandte Chemie</i> and presented my work at the <a href="https://www.2021oligomeeting.com/meeting-agenda" target="_blank">2021 Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Conference</a> as a competitively-selected early-career speaker. Very recently, I first-authored a manuscript under review at <i>Analytical Chemistry</i> on aptamer-based SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow tests, which is the rapid test I envisioned at SPS. <strong>Thanks to the unique resources available at UW, I've been able to collaborate with talented scientists on problems I witnessed firsthand, bolstering the research I can share with the scientific community.</strong>

Through my mentorship, Joey was able to greatly improve his confidence as a scientist. As a result, Joey received the Mary Gates Research Scholarship this past quarter, and I'm proud to continue to cultivate his scientific abilities for months to come.</p></h4>

Since starting at UW, I've maintained my small business for selling laser-cut items, such as <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/thebeanwarehouse" target="_blank">keychains, coasters</a>, <a href="https://shop.lasersnakeemporium.com/" target="_blank">game token sets, display cases</a>, <a href="http://www.thebeanwarehouse.com/" target="_blank">costume props</a>, and more. <strong>As orders grew to the tune of hundreds per month, I hired and taught my assistants how to prepare products and ship orders while also managing everyone's schedules to meet client deadlines.</strong> I gained valuable experience in how to manage trainees, which came in handy when I started to mentor Joey in the lab. Most importantly, I connect the dots and apply laser-cutting to nearly all facets of my life experiences. I not only craft functional pieces like <a href="https://meet.glowforge.com/earsavers/" target="_blank">"ear savers"</a> for SPS co-workers, but also great presents like biologically-accurate cell coasters to show gratitude to research collaborators.</p>

At <a href="http://students.washington.edu/uwkc/" target="_blank">the Kendo Club</a>, In line with the sports' deep roots in Japanese culture, I embrace the role of upperclassmen (<i>senpai</i>) and contribute meaningfully to the organization while not claiming a title. I attend practice consistently to support the club, even when our living rooms became our <i>dojo</i> over Zoom and enthusiasm sunk. I also contribute in small ways, such as custom-engraving bottle openers to give out at Dawg Days, editing photos for the club website, and giving rides to practices and events. <strong>As someone who led many clubs as an undergrad, I felt that some of the best club supporters are people who help generously without being required by their leadership title.</strong> Today, the club has a small but dedicated group of <i>senpai</i>, and we teach dozens of new beginner students every quarter. As we carefully resume in-person practices, I hope to continue to be a pillar of support for the Kendo Club at UW.

                    <h1>My Story: Pok&eacute;mon</h1>
                    <div class="col-md-8">
                      <h4><p>Beyond campus, I'm a keystone in the competitive Pok&eacute;mon community of UW and Seattle. As a member of the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/organize/" target="_blank">Pok&eacute;mon Professor program</a>, I organize and host casual open play (called <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/pokemon-events/play-in-a-league/" target="_blank">"Pok&eacute;mon League"</a>) and competitive tournaments for both the trading card game and the video game. <strong>When I first arrived on campus, I saw an opportunity to ignite the local Pok&eacute;mon scene at the UW.</strong> Noticing a dearth of Leagues in Seattle, I started a weekly League in the U District's The Dreaming Comics and Games, and also hosted weekly League at <a href="https://www.moxboardinghouse.com/seattle-events/" target="_blank">MOX Boarding House</a> in Ballard. As Leagues are open to the public, <strong>I warmly welcome players of all ages, orientations, and abilities to play.</strong> Sometimes it is challenging to teach children who are learning to read with Pok&eacute;mon cards, or manage the needs of guests on the spectrum. These experiences have bolstered my patience and ability to serve others even when situations leave my comfort zone. <strong>Today, I am still the only Seattle organizer to hold officially sanctioned video game tournaments, bringing in UW students, Portlanders, and even Canadians together for weekend Pok&eacute;mon battles.</strong>

                  <h4><p>Thanks to my ample local experience, <strong>I'm an invited staff member for regional and international tournaments in Columbus, Washington D.C., and other major cities.</strong> These tournaments attract hundreds of Pok&eacute;mon players across the country and the world. I not only learned teamwork and communication skills working with other Professors, but also led teams of judges as my reputation grew. <strong>Every Pok&eacute;mon tournament is an opportunity to foster the inclusive community and learn something new</strong>: I learned about a disabled player who needs a nurse to handle his cards, and I learned how to handle judge calls with non-English speakers while staffing the World Championships. Synthesizing my judge experience, I was invited to create and record training presentations for <a href="https://pokemonblog.com/tag/professor-university/" target="_blank">Professor University</a>, the official resource for Pok&eacute;mon volunteers. I'm still growing as a judge, but with each event I hope to become a better and more inclusive Pok&eacute;mon volunteer.

I cultivated my leadership expertise at Pok&eacute;mon tournaments, in Kendo Club, and in research collaborations to foster good work and inclusivity. As my fellow huskies wait to cross swords and battle with Pokémon in-person safely, I hope to accelerate our return to normal through my PhD thesis research on aptamers for COVID-19 applications. I'm ready to tackle the next problem and I couldn't be more excited to share my determination with you today. Thank you for considering me for the Husky 100!</h6>
